# Inventory Restoration Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When users placed orders, the available quantity decreased correctly. However, when orders were cancelled (either by users or admins) or items were returned, the available quantity was not being restored to the inventory. This caused inventory discrepancies and required manual updates.

## Root Cause
The admin order status update routes in both `server/routes/admin.js` and `server/routes/orders.js` were not handling inventory restoration when orders were cancelled or returned.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Admin Order Status Update Route (`server/routes/admin.js`)
**File:** `server/routes/admin.js` (lines 381-435)
**Issue:** Admin order cancellation didn't restore inventory
**Fix:** Added inventory restoration logic when order status changes to 'cancelled' or 'returned'

**Changes Made:**
- Added `.populate('items.product')` to get product details
- Added `previousStatus` tracking to avoid duplicate restoration
- Added inventory restoration logic:
  ```javascript
  // Handle inventory restoration when order is cancelled or returned
  if ((req.body.status === 'cancelled' && previousStatus !== 'cancelled') || 
      (req.body.status === 'returned' && previousStatus !== 'returned')) {
    
    // Return items to inventory
    for (const item of order.items) {
      const product = await Product.findById(item.product._id);
      if (product) {
        product.availableQuantity += item.quantity;
        await product.save();
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Fixed Regular Order Status Update Route (`server/routes/orders.js`)
**File:** `server/routes/orders.js` (lines 344-380)
**Issue:** Admin order cancellation through regular orders route didn't restore inventory
**Fix:** Applied the same inventory restoration logic as above

**Changes Made:**
- Same changes as admin route above
- Ensures consistency across both admin order management endpoints

## How It Works Now

### Order Placement
1. User places order → `availableQuantity` decreases
2. Inventory is automatically updated

### Order Cancellation (User)
1. User cancels order within 10 minutes → `availableQuantity` increases
2. Inventory is automatically restored

### Order Cancellation (Admin)
1. Admin cancels order → `availableQuantity` increases
2. Inventory is automatically restored
3. Admin inventory dashboard shows correct stats

### Order Return
1. User returns items → `availableQuantity` increases
2. Inventory is automatically restored

### Admin Inventory Management
1. Admin can manually restock products
2. Both `totalQuantity` and `availableQuantity` increase
3. No conflicts with automatic inventory restoration

## Benefits
- ✅ Automatic inventory restoration on order cancellation
- ✅ Automatic inventory restoration on item returns
- ✅ No manual inventory updates required
- ✅ Admin inventory dashboard shows accurate stats
- ✅ Prevents inventory discrepancies
- ✅ Works for both user and admin cancellations

## Testing
Created `test-inventory-restoration.js` to verify the fixes work correctly:
- Tests order placement (decreases inventory)
- Tests admin order cancellation (restores inventory)
- Tests admin inventory endpoint (shows correct stats)

## Files Modified
1. `server/routes/admin.js` - Fixed admin order status update route
2. `server/routes/orders.js` - Fixed regular order status update route
3. `test-inventory-restoration.js` - Created test script
4. `INVENTORY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Verification
The fixes ensure that:
- When orders are placed → inventory decreases
- When orders are cancelled → inventory increases
- When items are returned → inventory increases
- Admin inventory dashboard shows accurate statistics
- No manual inventory updates are needed
