# OTP-Based Registration Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of an OTP (One-Time Password) based email verification system for user registration in the Campus Connect application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Two-Step Registration Process
- **Step 1**: User fills out registration form and receives OTP via email
- **Step 2**: User enters OTP to verify email and complete registration

### 2. Backend API Endpoints

#### New Endpoints Added:
- `POST /api/auth/send-registration-otp` - Send OTP for registration
- `POST /api/auth/verify-registration-otp` - Verify OTP and complete registration
- `POST /api/auth/resend-registration-otp` - Resend OTP if needed

#### Modified Endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Now redirects to OTP flow

### 3. Database Schema Updates

#### User Model Changes:
```javascript
// Added to User schema
registrationOTP: String,           // Stores the OTP code
registrationOTPExpire: Date,       // OTP expiration timestamp
isEmailVerified: Boolean,          // Email verification status
```

### 4. Frontend Implementation

#### Registration Flow:
1. **Registration Form**: Collects user information
2. **OTP Verification Screen**: User enters 6-digit OTP
3. **Success**: User is logged in and redirected to home page

#### Features:
- Real-time OTP input validation
- 60-second countdown for resend button
- Error handling and user feedback
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (Node.js/Express)

#### 1. OTP Generation
```javascript
const otp = Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000).toString();
```

#### 2. Email Sending
- Uses Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP
- HTML email template with styled OTP display
- Error handling for email delivery failures

#### 3. OTP Validation
- 6-digit numeric OTP
- 10-minute expiration time
- One-time use (cleared after verification)

#### 4. Security Features
- Temporary user creation with `isEmailVerified: false`
- OTP expiration handling
- Duplicate email/student ID prevention
- Input validation and sanitization

### Frontend (React)

#### 1. State Management
```javascript
const [step, setStep] = useState(1);           // 1: Form, 2: OTP
const [userEmail, setUserEmail] = useState('');
const [otp, setOtp] = useState('');
const [countdown, setCountdown] = useState(0);
```

#### 2. OTP Input Features
- Auto-formatting (numbers only)
- Real-time validation
- 6-digit limit enforcement
- Clear error messages

#### 3. User Experience
- Loading states during API calls
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Countdown timer for resend functionality
- Back button to return to registration form

## API Response Examples

### Send Registration OTP
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "OTP sent to your email address",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

### Verify Registration OTP
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Registration completed successfully!",
  "user": {
    "id": "user_id",
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "user",
    "studentId": "STU001",
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "phone": "1234567890",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses
```json
{
  "message": "Invalid OTP"
}
```
```json
{
  "message": "OTP has expired"
}
```

## Email Template

The OTP email includes:
- Professional HTML styling
- Clear OTP display with large font
- Security warnings and instructions
- Branding consistent with the application

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### Gmail Setup
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate app password
3. Use app password in EMAIL_PASS

## Testing

### Backend Testing
Run the test script:
```bash
node test-otp-registration.js
```

### Frontend Testing
1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to `/register`
3. Fill out the registration form
4. Check email for OTP
5. Enter OTP to complete registration

## Security Considerations

1. **OTP Expiration**: 10-minute timeout prevents brute force attacks
2. **One-time Use**: OTP is cleared after successful verification
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for OTP requests
4. **Email Security**: OTP emails include security warnings
5. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Invalid OTP**: User enters wrong code
2. **Expired OTP**: OTP has passed 10-minute limit
3. **Email Failure**: SMTP server issues
4. **Duplicate User**: Email or student ID already exists
5. **Network Issues**: Connection problems

### User Feedback
- Clear error messages
- Toast notifications
- Loading states
- Retry mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

1. **SMS OTP**: Add SMS-based OTP as alternative
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting
3. **Email Templates**: More sophisticated email designs
4. **Analytics**: Track OTP success/failure rates
5. **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email Not Received**
   - Check spam folder
   - Verify email configuration
   - Check server logs

2. **OTP Verification Fails**
   - Ensure OTP is 6 digits
   - Check if OTP has expired
   - Verify email address matches

3. **Server Errors**
   - Check MongoDB connection
   - Verify environment variables
   - Review server logs

## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required env vars are set
2. **Email Configuration**: Test email delivery in production
3. **Database**: Ensure MongoDB is accessible
4. **SSL**: Use HTTPS in production for security
5. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring

## Conclusion

The OTP-based registration system provides:
- Enhanced security through email verification
- Better user experience with clear feedback
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements

This implementation ensures that only users with valid email addresses can register, reducing fake accounts and improving overall system security.
